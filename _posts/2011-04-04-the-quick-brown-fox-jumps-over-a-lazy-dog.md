As the industry fights to redefine what success looks like, gender becomes the ultimate game-changer. ” 


## Rising Action
As the cannon's roar signals the start of the battle, the question echos: *What fuels the quest to understand gender representation in cinema?* The past holds the clues, and a visual narrative begins to take shape.

This graph reveals the trajectory of female representation in films from 1980 to 2014. The data reveals fluctuations in the average percentage of female actors in the 80s, with a **gradual upward trend** from the 90s onwards. However, this graph only gives infomation as a proportion of female actors. Let us take a closer look at the distribution of the frequency of female actors vs male actors.

This barplot shows that both male and female frenquency count have a normal distribution. While the peak frequency for male actors occurs at higher actor counts, female actors reach their peak frequency at significantly lower actor counts. This underscores a **disparity in representation**. Therefore, male actors appear to dominate ensemble casts, while female actors appear to be represented in smaller numbers. 

As the battle starts, a new participant enters the arena, **movie genres**. *Will they underline a more equitable fight for representation or will they deepen the dissparities even more?*

This barplot reveals the distribution of average female actor percentages across various movie genres. **Action/adventure** movies show the lowest representation, with female actors averaging just over 20%. In contrast, genres such as **comedy**, **drama**, and **horror** exhibit significantly higher percentages, nearing 35%. These findings suggest that representation varies substantially depending on the movie genre. While some genres appear more inclusive, others, particularly **action-oriented** ones, appear to remain male-dominated. 

Like mentioned before, the past holds the clues. With movie genres entering the fight, the viewers wonder: *have they always been relevant fighters throughout history?*

When toggling between genres, distinct patterns emerge regarding the historical representation of female actors. In **drama**, the average female actor percentage has shown consistent growth from the late 1980s, peaking in the early 2000s before a slight decline. **Comedy**, on the other hand, demonstrates more fluctuations but maintains relatively high representation throughout the years.

**Fantasy** tells a different story, with spikes in female representation during specific years, indicating efforts to highlight strong female leads. In contrast, **thriller** and **horror** genres show inconsistency, though **horror** experienced a significant peak around the 2010s, perhaps reflecting shifts in audience preferences for gender diversity.

The **action/adventure** genre remains the most male-dominated, with female representation rarely exceeding 30%. 

> All of these ongoing fights for representation keep the viewers of the capitol on the edge of their seats. The questions still echo, *who truly holds the power in the Gender Games arena?*
