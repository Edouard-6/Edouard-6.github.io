## Exposition: Setting the scene
> “In the vibrant world of cinema, where narratives come to life, another story unfolds behind the curtains: one of financial figures and critical applaud. We're peeling back the layers to reveal what truly propels a movie to box office success. Just as every character, every movie has its unique path to glory or obscurity. So, what truly makes a movie successful? Is it profit margins, widespread acclaim, or a combination of both?“

## Rising Action: Gathering momentum

We see two distinct paths to success in the world of cinema. On one hand, there are the blockbuster giants with huge box office profits. On the other, there are movies that captivate critics and audiences alike, earning high ratings, though perhaps not filling theaters to the peak. This fascinating divide encourages us to dig deeper. Do glowing reviews always lead to financial success? What can we learn from the showdown between beloved underdogs and big budget spectacles about what really defines a movie’s success?

Our investigation reveals a surprising leader: Horror films, typically produced on lower budgets, are ahead in the ROI race. This genre's ability to captivate and terrify audiences yields big returns, demonstrating that huge investments are not always necessary for lucrative outcomes.

Close on its heels, Fantasy and Comedy genres share the spotlight in the second tier. Fantasy films, with their grandiose themes and elaborate worlds, alongside comedies, which bring laughter and light hearted escapism, both manage to secure strong financial returns, proving their consistent appeal.

Lagging but not defeated, Drama and Thriller genres show resilience. While they may not always achieve sky high ROI, their ability to draw audiences with compelling narratives and intense suspense keeps them important in the cinematic world.

This diverse spectrum of success lets us wonder: Do glowing reviews align with financial triumphs?

A fascinating trend emerges when we analyse the ROI by ratings over the years. Notably, in the years 1971, 1980, 1983, 1985, and 2014, movies with lower ratings (below 6.5) surprisingly outperformed the higher rating movies in terms of ROI. These anomalies suggest that sometimes, lower rated movies can achieve unexpected financial success, possibly due to niche appeal or effective budget management.

Moreover, a historical perspective reveals a shift in the correlation between ratings and ROI. Prior to 1995, there was a more pronounced correlation where films with higher ratings generally saw higher ROI. This reflects a period when critical success was more closely tied to financial outcomes. However, post 1995, this correlation diminishes with the ROI lines for high-rated and low-rated movies converging closely. This change underscores a diversifying cinematic landscape where a high rating is no longer a guaranteed ticket to financial success.

## Climax: The turning point

As we reach the peak of our cinematic journey, we spotlight films that shatter norms: those unexpected gems that achieve high ROI despite poor reviews, alongside the big budget films that disappoint despite their hype. This pivotal moment in our exploration challenges our traditional perceptions of success and invites us to reconsider what we truly value in cinema. Can films with mediocre reviews but high financial returns truly be considered successful? Are these exceptions to the rule anomalies, or do they reveal an underlying pattern about what drives a movie's financial success?

Unexpected gems: Films like Twilight, My Bloody Valentine, Pocahontas, Saw, and Scream emerge as financial victors despite receiving poor reviews. These films, often dismissed by critics, have nonetheless captivated audiences sufficiently to generate significant box office returns. Their success raises intriguing questions about the factors beyond ratings that contribute to financial profitability.

Hyped financial failures: In the contrary, movies such as Salvador, The Grindhouse, and Michael Collins receive high praise from critics but do not translate this acclaim into box office gold. These movies, while perhaps cherished for their artistic merit, showcase the complex relationship between a movies's perceived quality and its economic outcome.


## Falling Action: Unraveling insights

As our narrative unfolds, we take a closer look at the genres that are losing their luster at the box office. This exploration dives into how viewer preferences and industry dynamics are evolving over time. Which movie genres are seeing a fall in popularity or financial success, and what's driving these changes? Let’s unpack the factors contributing to these shifts and what they might mean for the future of cinema.

Fantasy's remarkable rise: Starting from the lower ranks in the 1970s, the fantasy genre has shown a steady ascent, securing the second spot in the last decade. This rise reflects a growing appetite for escapism, global market expansions and the increasing creativity and special effects technologgy that brings fantastical worlds to life.

Comedy's peak and plateau: Dominating in the 1970s, the comedy genre experienced a sharp economic decline through the 1980s, stabilizing in subsequent decades. This trend suggests a shift in humor preferences or possibly saturation within the genre, however it recalibrated production strategies to align with audience expectations.

Horror's resilient comeback: After maintaining a consistent performance, horror saw a decline along with other genres but made a notable comeback in the 2000s, leading in the last decade. This resurgence might be linked to low production costs and high profit margins, coupled with a strong, dedicated fanbase that thrives on both theatrical and digital platforms.

Drama and Thriller's gradual decline: These genres have seen a gradual decrease in ROI, landing them at lower positions in recent decades. This downward trend may reflect higher production costs, a competitive entertainment landscape, and a shift towards more visually driven, high concept genres that perform well internationally.

Our exploration into the average ratings by genre across decades uncovers a general decline in ratings, suggesting an increasingly critical audience and intensifying competition among movies. Despite the high ROI achieved by certain genres, their critical ratings tell a different story:

Drama leads in ratings: Oten revered for its deep narrative and character development, tops the ratings chart in the most recent decade, despite not being the leader in ROI. This illustrates that while not always the most profitable, drama continues to hold a prestigious place in viewers’ esteem.

Fantasy follows closely: While enjoying good ROI, also maintain strong ratings, indicating a balance of financial and critical success.

Thriller follows closely: While having relatively bad ROI, have strong ratings.

Horror and Comedy show disparity: Interestingly, horror and comedy genres, despite their financial successes, rank lower in critical ratings.

As we arrive to the end of our movie success journey, we discover that the secret to a movie's success isn't just about hitting high ROI numbers or gaining good reviews alone. Instead, it's the complex dance between these factors, along with genre dynamics, that truly shapes a film’s fate in the modern movie industry.
