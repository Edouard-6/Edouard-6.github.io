## Exposition: Setting the scene
> “In the vibrant world of cinema, where narratives come to life, another story unfolds behind the curtains: one of financial figures and critical applaud. We're peeling back the layers to reveal what truly propels a movie to box office success. Just as every character, every movie has its unique path to glory or obscurity. So, what truly makes a movie successful? Is it profit margins, widespread acclaim, or a combination of both?“

## Rising Action: Gathering momentum
We see two distinct paths to success in the world of cinema. On one hand, there are the blockbuster giants with huge box office profits. On the other, there are movies that captivate critics and audiences alike, earning high ratings, though perhaps not filling theaters to the peak. This fascinating divide encourages us to dig deeper. Do glowing reviews always lead to financial success? What can we learn from the showdown between beloved underdogs and big budget spectacles about what really defines a movie’s success?

## Climax: The turning point
As we reach the peak of our cinematic journey, we spotlight films that shatter norms: those unexpected gems that achieve high ROI despite poor reviews, alongside the big budget films that disappoint despite their hype. This pivotal moment in our exploration challenges our traditional perceptions of success and invites us to reconsider what we truly value in cinema. Can films with mediocre reviews but high financial returns truly be considered successful? Are these exceptions to the rule anomalies, or do they reveal an underlying pattern about what drives a movie's financial success?
