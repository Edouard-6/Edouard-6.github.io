## Introduction: The Streaming Empire

Once a niche, the streaming empire has now become the dominant force in the entertainment universe. As the Siths named Netflix, Hulu, and Disney+ vie for the attention of millions, filmmakers face a new reality: success no longer just means filling up theaters; it means dominating the digital world.

The stakes are higher than ever as streaming platforms push the boundaries of genre and storytelling. Which movies will rise to the occasion and capture the hearts of the digital generation? The battle for streaming supremacy is just getting started.

## Exposition: Gender, Genre, and Success

### Key Question:
Do gender diverse films perform better on streaming platforms?

### A New Hope for Diversity:


In the vast galaxy of streaming, where countless films struggle for attention like Jedi against the dark side, diversity emerges as a beacon of hope. While some believe that films with balanced gender representation naturally connect with broader audiences, this remains an untested hypothesis. The idea that inclusive stories create universal appeal is alluring, but only data can reveal whether it truly holds the power to reshape the industry.

Our mission is to explore how representation influences ratings and viewership. Is diversity the chosen one to restore balance to storytelling, or just another trend influenced by external forces like marketing and genre popularity? The answers lie ahead, waiting to be uncovered by the Force of analysis.

The histogram of `Movie_release_date` matches the growth of streaming platforms around 2015. Much like the Rebel Alliance rallying against the Empire, platforms like Netflix began producing their own content and expand their services accross the galaxy. The recent spike in film releases reflects the streaming era's growth and can also show us how our society is evolving.




## Analysis of Female Representation Over Time

### Key Observations:


<iframe src="/assets/html/comp_percentage_of_female_streamingvsboxoffice.html" width="150%" height="600px" frameborder="0"></iframe>

- **Steady Increase in Female Representation:**
  - Both streaming platforms and box office movies have an increase of the percentage of female actors over time. This shows that society is moving toward including more genders in storytelling, reflecting the Rebel Alliance's efforts to bring balance and inclusivity to the galaxy.


- **Streaming Platforms Lead in Inclusivity:**
  - Streaming platforms consistently outperform box office movies in terms of female representation, leading the charge confronting the Empire.
  - This trend is probably because streaming platforms have more freedom and flexibility which helps them include more diversity compared to traditional cinema.

- **Post-2015 Spike:**
  - The rise in female representation becomes more noticeable after 2015, coinciding with the expansion of streaming platforms like Netflix and their focus on original content.This supports the idea that streaming platforms are driving more inclusive practices.


- **Variability in Box Office Movies:**
  - The representation of female actors in box office movies shows greater variability, potentially influenced by blockbuster genresthat traditionally prioritize male-dominated casts.
