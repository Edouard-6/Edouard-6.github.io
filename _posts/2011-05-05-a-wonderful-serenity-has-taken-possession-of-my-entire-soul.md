# A New Hope for Diversity:

In the vast galaxy of streaming, where countless films struggle for attention like Jedi against the dark side, diversity emerges as a beacon of hope. While some believe that films with balanced gender representation naturally connect with broader audiences, this remains an untested hypothesis. The idea that inclusive stories create universal appeal is alluring but only data can reveal whether it truly holds the power to reshape the industry.

Our mission is to explore how representation influences ratings and viewership. Is diversity the chosen one to restore balance to storytelling, or just another trend influenced by external forces like marketing and genre popularity? The answers lie ahead, waiting to be uncovered by the Force of analysis.


We’ll embark on a journey with the assistance of our loyal droids : R2D2 and C3PO. These companions will help us navigate the complexities of data analysis, ensuring no detail escapes their watchful sensors. Together, we’ll uncover the truth about gender diversity and its impact on the streaming galaxy.

 R2D2 has assembled the following visualizations. With his keen analytical circuits, these charts reveal insights into the rise of streaming platforms in the galaxy.

-  The histogram of Movie_release_date matches the growth of streaming platforms around 2015. Much like the Rebel Alliance rallying against the Empire, platforms like Netflix began producing their own content and expand their services accross the galaxy. C3P0 tell us that the small decrease of the curve after 2020 is due to the lack of current datas in their set. The recent spike in film releases reflects the streaming era's growth and can also show us how our society is evolving.

- The histograms of Male_actors and Female_actors show distinct patterns. Streaming platforms tend to have a more balanced distribution between men and women. This inclusivity contrasts with box office movies which remain globaly influenced by the dark side genres traditionally dominated by male casts.


- The Movie_runtime histogram highlights how streaming platforms often favor shorter films, catering to the preference of binge-watching audiences. This trend contrasts with box office movies, which still feature longer runtimes, possibly due to the theatrical experience expectations.




## Analysis of Female Representation Over Time

<iframe src="/assets/html/comp_percentage_of_female_streamingvsboxoffice.html" width="100%" height="600px" frameborder="0"></iframe>

- *Steady Increase in Female Representation:*
  - Both streaming platforms and box office movies have an increase of the percentage of female actors over time. This shows that society is moving toward including more genders in storytelling, reflecting the Rebel Alliance's efforts to bring balance and inclusivity to the galaxy.


- *Streaming Platforms Lead in Inclusivity:*
  - Streaming platforms consistently outperform box office movies in terms of female representation, leading the charge confronting the Empire.
  - This trend is probably because streaming platforms have more freedom and flexibility which helps them include more diversity compared to traditional cinema.

- *Post-2015 Spike:*
  - The rise in female representation becomes more noticeable after 2015, coinciding with the expansion of streaming platforms like Netflix and their focus on original content.This supports the idea that streaming platforms are driving more inclusive practices.


- *Variability in Box Office Movies:*
  - The representation of female actors in box office movies shows greater variability, potentially influenced by blockbuster genresthat traditionally prioritize male-dominated casts.

### Visualization Idea:

- The presence of female actors in genres such as Drama, Science Fiction, and Comedy showcases progress in creating more diverse stories that resonate with audiences.
- This balance demonstrates a collective effort by the film industry to reflect societal changes and meet audience expectations for gender diversity.

# Rising Action: Measuring Success in the Digital Age

As streaming platforms grow, so does their potential to shape culture. But does their inclusivity impact success?


As we explore deeper into the streaming galaxy, we crossed paths with Master Yoda, who shared his timeless wisdom. "Ratings, the measure of success they are," he reminded us. "Reflect, they do, the reception and popularity of films and series."

To measure success, we will rely on user ratings. Streaming platforms use algorithms which analyze users reviews to recommend content.  metrics will serve as a proxy for gauging success in our analysis. By examining how ratings correlate with factors like gender diversity and genre, we aim to uncover the dynamics that drive engagement on these platforms.

### Key Question:
How do gender representation and genre correlate with critical success or popularity?

### Visualization Idea:
- *Scatter Plot:* Gender representation vs. popularity metrics (e.g., user ratings or reviews).
