## Rising Action:
### A New Hope for Diversity:

In the vast galaxy of streaming, where countless films struggle for attention like Jedi against the dark side, diversity emerges as a beacon of hope. While some believe that films with balanced gender representation naturally connect with broader audiences, this remains an untested hypothesis. The idea that inclusive stories create universal appeal is alluring but only data can reveal whether it truly holds the power to reshape the industry.

Our mission is to explore how representation influences ratings and viewership. Is diversity the chosen one to restore balance to storytelling, or just another trend influenced by external forces like marketing and genre popularity? The answers lie ahead, waiting to be uncovered by the Force of analysis.


We’ll embark on a journey with the assistance of our loyal droids : R2D2 and C3PO. These companions will help us navigate the complexities of data analysis, ensuring no detail escapes their watchful sensors. Together, we’ll uncover the truth about gender diversity and its impact on the streaming galaxy.

 R2D2 has assembled the following visualizations. With his keen analytical circuits, these charts reveal insights into the rise of streaming platforms in the galaxy.

<iframe src="/assets/html/Movie_release_date_kde.html" width="100%" height="600px" frameborder="0"></iframe>
<iframe src="/assets/html/Movie_runtime_kde.html" width="100%" height="600px" frameborder="0"></iframe>
<iframe src="/assets/html/Female_actors_kde.html" width="100%" height="600px" frameborder="0"></iframe>
<iframe src="/assets/html/Male_actors_kde.html" width="100%" height="600px" frameborder="0"></iframe>

-  The histogram of Movie_release_date matches the growth of streaming platforms around 2015. Much like the Rebel Alliance rallying against the Empire, platforms like Netflix began producing their own content and expand their services accross the galaxy. C3P0 tell us that the small decrease of the curve after 2020 is due to the lack of current datas in their set. The recent spike in film releases reflects the streaming era's growth and can also show us how our society is evolving.

- The histograms of Male_actors and Female_actors show distinct patterns. Streaming platforms tend to have a more balanced distribution between men and women. This inclusivity contrasts with box office movies which remain globaly influenced by the dark side genres traditionally dominated by male casts.


- The Movie_runtime histogram highlights how streaming platforms often favor shorter films, catering to the preference of binge-watching audiences. This trend contrasts with box office movies, which still feature longer runtimes, possibly due to the theatrical experience expectations.




### Analysis of Female Representation Over Time

<iframe src="/assets/html/comp_percentage_of_female_streamingvsboxoffice.html" width="100%" height="600px" frameborder="0"></iframe>

- *Steady Increase in Female Representation:*
  - Both streaming platforms and box office movies have an increase of the percentage of female actors over time. This shows that society is moving toward including more genders in storytelling, reflecting the Rebel Alliance's efforts to bring balance and inclusivity to the galaxy.


- *Streaming Platforms Lead in Inclusivity:*
  - Streaming platforms consistently outperform box office movies in terms of female representation, leading the charge confronting the Empire.
  - This trend is probably because streaming platforms have more freedom and flexibility which helps them include more diversity compared to traditional cinema.

- *Post-2015 Spike:*
  - The rise in female representation becomes more noticeable after 2015, coinciding with the expansion of streaming platforms like Netflix and their focus on original content.This supports the idea that streaming platforms are driving more inclusive practices.


- *Variability in Box Office Movies:*
  - The representation of female actors in box office movies shows greater variability, potentially influenced by blockbuster genresthat traditionally prioritize male-dominated casts.

## Climax: Measuring Success in the Digital Age

As we explore deeper into the streaming galaxy, we crossed paths with Master Yoda, who shared his timeless wisdom. "Ratings, the measure of success they are," he reminded us. "Reflect, they do, the reception and popularity of films and series."

<img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/drichmdyj/image/upload/v1734655232/star-wars-yoda_cwydcr.gif" alt="R2D2 and C3P0 GIF" width="500">

To measure success, we will rely on user ratings. Streaming platforms use algorithms which analyze users reviews to recommend content. These metrics will serve as a proxy for gauging success in our analysis. By examining how ratings correlate with factors like gender diversity and genre, we aim to uncover the dynamics that drive engagement on these platforms.

During our travels across the cinematic galaxy, our ship's scanners revealed the **average movie ratings by country**, visualized on this map. We can see Each region displays the audience’s general appreciation for films, highlighting diverse viewing preferences.

<iframe src="/assets/html/analyze_countries_plotly.html" width="100%" height="600px" frameborder="0"></iframe>





- Countries with darker shades show higher average ratings, showcasing regions where films are more successfull. The average ratings across countries should not be interpreted at face value due to unbalanced distribution of movies across regions. United States and India dominate the dataset with far more films than others, which could skew interpretations of their average ratings.
- This global overviewpeti sparks curiosity about the factors influencing ratings : Could it be the genres, the languages spoken, or the cultural values embedded in films?

Master Yoda's wisdom inspires our next step: exploring the relationship between ratings, gender, genres, and the languages spoken in these regions. A regression analysis might uncover how these elements shape audience reception and define the succes metric.

## Falling Action: Regression Analysis

| Statistic            | Value         |
|-----------------------|---------------|
| Dep. Variable         | Average_ratings |
| R-squared            | 0.099         |
| Adj. R-squared       | 0.095         |
| F-statistic          | 24.33         |
| Prob (F-statistic)   | 4.97e-73      |


| Variable               | Coefficient | Std. Error | t-Value  | p-value  | [0.025      0.975] |
|------------------------|-------------|------------|----------|----------|--------------------|
| const                  | 6.2561      | 0.017      | 367.013  | 0.000    | 6.223      6.290  |
| Female_actors          | -0.1248     | 0.018      | -6.781   | 0.000    | -0.161     -0.089 |
| Male_actors            | -0.0550     | 0.019      | -2.922   | 0.004    | -0.092     -0.018 |
| Movie_runtime          | 0.2588      | 0.021      | 12.605   | 0.000    | 0.219      0.299  |
| Is_not_only_english    | 0.0451      | 0.024      | 1.865    | 0.062    | -0.002     0.092  |
| Is_USA_movie           | 0.1538      | 0.025      | 6.213    | 0.000    | 0.105      0.202  |
| Platform_Disney        | 0.1346      | 0.027      | 4.949    | 0.000    | 0.081      0.188  |
| Platform_Netflix       | 0.0899      | 0.027      | 3.304    | 0.001    | 0.037      0.143  |


The regression analysis gave us some useful insights, but its ability to explain the data was limited. Here are the main points:

- R2D2 find a low R<sup>2</sup> value of 0.099 indicates that only about 10% of the variance in Average_ratings is explained by the model. This suggests that many other factors influencing ratings were not captured in the analysis.

Significant Predictors:

- Both Female_actors and Male_actors showed negative coefficients. The reasons behind these effects remain unclear and need further investigation.

- Movie_runtime emerged as a strong positive predictor. It's aligning with the idea that the longer movies tend to receive higher ratings.

- Platform_Disney and Platform_Netflix positively influenced ratings, reflecting the popularity of content on these platforms.

- Limitations: While some predictors were significant, the model doesn't fully explain what affects audience ratings.


## Resolution

The regression analysis revealed some intriguing patterns, yet it is clear that this battle is far from over. With an R<sup>2</sup> of only 0.099, much remains unexplained about the factors shaping audience reception. Just as C3P0 and R2D2 never give up despite setbacks, we too must continue refining our tools. One day, through enhanced models and deeper exploration, we will triumph in decoding the dynamics of success in the streaming galaxy. This analysis is merely the beginning of a greater journey to understand the forces at play.
